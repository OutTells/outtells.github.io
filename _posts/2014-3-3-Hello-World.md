title: Portfolio report August 3 2020
---

**Aug 3**

**General portfolio things**
The portfolio is heavily concentrated on Qt and Remedy. Remedy being around 40%. I have been thinking about selling parts of these positions due to worsened risk profiles. Both companies showing bad news would mean a massive drop in the portfolio, and would wipe me out of the full-time investing game. 

**Angler Gaming @ 16 SEK**
Not much on this front. The degree of upside should be explored.

**Bublar Group @ 3,75 SEK**
This position is questionable. The company has many parts and I'm not sure how the whole comes together. 

**ENLABS @ 26 SEK**
American hedge fund Alta Fox Capital entered a position, analysis calling for very high upside over the next 5 years. A lot of the points coincide with thoughts I had before. This felt redeeming after the lackluster performance of the share this year. I've increased my position to about 15%. Short-term drop in the price is possible.

**Freetrailer @ 5,25 DKK**
Interesting case. Will follow for a while.

**Qt @ 28 EUR**
Report on Friday. Will hold and see. Might trim the position afterwards, depending on the outlook. Bulk of the position will stay as long as the story is intact.

**Remedy @ 24 EUR**
Valuation is problematic. Risk profile has worsened this year. Thinking of selling parts of the position. About 30% and largest on my portfolio.

**Scout Gaming @ 38 SEK**
Valuation very high. Will not buy at these levels unless situation changes. Will buy dips.

**Talenom @ 9,20 EUR**
I sold my position in 2 parts in the past 2 weeks. The report had a negative effect on the share price, which I had anticipated from the very high valuation. Considerations for re-entry.

**Short-term trades**
On the short-term I'm holding Revenio and Digia. I will hold Digia until the report and see from there. Revenio is kind of a cash substitute, sold when needed.
