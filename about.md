In this blog I am going to provide thoughts about video games from my own point of view. I often have insights popping into my mind while playing games – insights that I tend to forget. This is my attempt at preserving those insights. I hope those insights may provide to be of value to others. 
I will not be consciously limiting the subjects I wish to discuss. If a game causes me to think about things not really related to video games, that’s what I will write about.
